//! Canonical wire types for hub-proxied `workspace.*` RPC methods,
//! shared by the server (hub_server), the shell proxy client
//! (`WorkspaceOps`), and clients that cannot depend on
//! `pi-grok-workspace`. Types not yet migrated here live next to their
//! `WorkspaceOp` impls in that crate; each type has exactly one
//! [`WorkspaceRpc`] impl. [`RpcError`]-code-to-error-enum mapping is
//! deliberately not defined here.
