//! Minimal (scrollback-native) render mode — `grok --minimal`.
//!
//! In this mode finalized conversation blocks are printed once into the
//! terminal's *native* scrollback (via `pi_ratatui_inline::Terminal::insert_before`,
//! reusing `EntryRenderer`) while a small pinned live region holds the
//! running-turn status, the prompt, and a minimal status line. The interactive
//! `ScrollbackPane` (scroll, fold, selection, mouse) is not used; the terminal
//! owns history.
//!
//! - [`commit`] — committed-frontier logic, display policy, and the per-frame
//!   commit-to-scrollback pass.
//! - [`live`] — the pinned live region (tail + todos + `/btw` + status + prompt).
//! - [`todo`] — the persistent todo panel shown above the prompt.
//! - [`auth`] — the in-region sign-in flow shown before a session exists.
//! - [`overlay`] — the inline-overlay host (prompt-anchored dropdowns; grows /
//!   shrinks the live viewport).
//!
//! # Wiring
//!
//! `pi-pager` (the lib) does **not** depend on this crate — that would be
//! a cargo dependency cycle, since this crate reads deeply into the pager's
//! [`AppView`] / view model. Instead the pager exposes an inversion-of-control
//! seam ([`pi_pager::minimal_hook`]) of function pointers, and the
//! composition-root binary (`pi-pager-bin`) calls [`install`] once at
//! startup to register this crate's [`draw`] entry point. When the seam is not
//! installed the pager's minimal-mode branches are inert.

/// Per-frame entry point for minimal mode, called from [`AppView::draw`].
///
/// Order matters:
/// 0. Open a synchronized update and adopt the current terminal size (see
///    below), so every write this frame — commits *and* the live region —
///    presents atomically at the right dimensions.
/// 1. Commit the pending welcome card (fresh session / `/new`) so it lands
///    above the first conversation block, and push any ready plan into
///    scrollback (`plan::maybe_commit_plan`) so it commits like a normal block
///    this frame — the live region then holds only the plan's decision controls.
/// 2. Size the viewport to its **post-commit** height (see
///    [`overlay::sync_viewport`] / [`live::tail_height`]). This runs *before* the
///    commit so that step 3's `insert_before` prints each finalized block and
///    repositions the correctly-sized viewport to sit directly after it
///    (content-anchored — the prompt follows the content, and once the screen is
///    full that position is the bottom). Otherwise the viewport was still at its
///    tall streaming height when the block committed, and the following shrink
///    stranded the prompt at the top of the screen ("input snaps to the top").
/// 3. Commit finalized blocks into native scrollback (each `insert_before`
///    scrolls committed rows up above the pinned viewport), then re-print any
///    `Ctrl+E` / `/expand` re-prints fully expanded below.
/// 4. Redraw the live region (tail · status · overlay · prompt) into the
///    viewport's final position.
///
/// ## Why step 0 exists (resize + flicker)
///
/// **Resize:** `draw_frame` runs `terminal.autoresize()` — but that is the
/// *last* step of this function, while the commit passes read
/// `viewport_area().width` first. On the frame that processes a terminal
/// resize, a block finalizing in that same frame would be laid out and printed
/// at the *stale* width; a shrink then hard-wraps every over-wide row on the
/// real terminal, permanently garbling the print-once committed copy. Adopting
/// the new size up front closes that window (a no-op on non-resize frames).
///
/// **Flicker:** the commit `insert_before`s scroll + repaint the screen and
/// flush per chunk. Without a synchronized update around them, a multi-block
/// commit (thinking + tool + message finalizing together) presents as several
/// visible scroll/paint bursts before the live region repaints. Opening the
/// synchronized update *before* the commits batches the whole frame — commits,
/// viewport reposition, and live redraw — into one atomic present. The
/// matching `EndSynchronizedUpdate` is emitted by `draw_frame` (step 4), which
/// every path through this function reaches; its own inner
/// `BeginSynchronizedUpdate` is redundant-but-harmless (DEC 2026 is a mode,
/// not a counter — the first End closes it).
