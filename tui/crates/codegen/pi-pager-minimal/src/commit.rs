/// so the leading-run scan stops *before* it and it stays in the live region
/// until the user answers.
///
/// **Lingering-`is_running` agent messages (the "accumulate, don't cap" fix):**
/// the tracker leaves an agent message's `is_running` flag set until turn end —
/// `handle_tool_call` resets `current_agent_msg` to `None` *without* finishing
/// the entry when a tool follows. That stale flag would wedge the frontier at
/// the message, piling the rest of the turn into the live tail. A later
/// *turn-progress* block (tool / next message / session event / …) proves the
/// tracker moved on and will never append again, so we commit it. Interleaved
/// **thinking** does not: `handle_thought_chunk` pushes a thinking entry
/// *after* the message without resetting `current_agent_msg`, so later tokens
/// still append. Treating that as "done" print-once-freezes the first word(s)
/// on the terminal (GBS-28). Only agent messages get this relaxation: a
/// running **tool** may still update its result, so it keeps the strict
/// `is_running` gate, and the **last** entry always stays live.
///
/// **Background-task lifecycle blocks commit even while "running".** A fresh
/// background task is pushed as a `BgTask` "started" block with the entry's
/// `is_running` flag set (`handle_task_backgrounded` → `set_last_running(true)`),
/// but that flag only drives bullet animation — the block's *content* never
/// changes (task completion pushes a **separate** `bg_task_completed`/`failed`
/// block, and live output goes to the task store, not this entry). An async task
/// can outlive its turn, so gating it on `is_running` would wedge the commit
/// frontier for the rest of the turn: the "started" block — and everything after
/// it — would stay stuck in the live tail (scrolled out of view), so the task is
/// invisible until it finishes. Committing it immediately matches design §6.11
/// ("status blocks committed") and keeps the frontier moving.
///
/// Once the turn is **idle** (`turn_running == false`) everything except a
/// pending-user-input block is stable and committable: the tracker can also
/// leave a thinking block's `is_running` flag set after the turn ends (finalize
/// missed at a transition), and that stale flag must not permanently wedge the
/// commit frontier. The caller finalizes such entries before rendering so they
/// print in their finished form. The pending-input gate deliberately applies in
/// every turn state (see the first check below).
///
/// ⚠️ **Print-once caveat for idle-pushed running blocks:** a spinner-style
/// entry pushed as `running` while the turn is idle is committed *immediately*
