//! Inversion-of-control seam for the optional minimal (scrollback-native)
//! render mode.
//!
//! `pi-pager` cannot depend on `pi-pager-minimal`: that crate reads
//! this crate's view model (`AppView`, the `views::*` widgets, `scrollback`),
//! so a direct dependency would form a cargo cycle. Instead the minimal crate
//! registers its entry points here via [`install`], and this crate dispatches
//! into them through the stored function pointers.
//!
//! The composition-root binary (`pi-pager-bin`) wires it up once at
//! startup by calling `pi_pager_minimal::install()`. When nothing has
//! installed the seam, the pager's `ScreenMode::Minimal` branches are inert
//! (`draw` is a no-op, `/transcript` falls back to the empty case) — the
//! default full-screen and inline render paths never touch this module.
