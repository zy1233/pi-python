//! Scroll flight recorder — `GROK_SCROLL_LOG` JSONL log of scroll-stream
//! transitions, for offline analysis of real gestures.
//!
//! The scroll-debug HUD ([`crate::views::scroll_debug_hud`]) samples state
//! per frame; this recorder captures every state-machine transition
//! event-exactly: one line per stream start, per line-delivering flush
//! (zero-delta flush attempts are not logged — their spacing shows up in
//! `ms_since_prev_flush`), and per finalize. Records are flat JSON objects,
//! one per line, and the writer flushes on finalize records so `tail -f` +
//! `jq` work mid-session. In captures from before the finalize-decel fix, a
//! tick-path finalize with a large `flushed` and nonzero `dropped` long
//! after the last `evt="flush"` line is the rear-end burst signature; fixed
//! producers drain tapered `trigger="tick"` flushes instead and finalize
//! with `flushed: 0`, where `dropped` counts only coast-budget write-offs
//! (see [`super::mouse`]).
//!
//! Enablement: `GROK_SCROLL_LOG=1` (or set-but-empty) logs to
//! `~/.grok/logs/scroll-log-<timestamp>.jsonl`; any other non-`0` value is
//! used as the target path. Unset (or `0`, matching `GROK_SCROLL_DEBUG`)
//! disables: [`super::mouse::MouseScrollState`] then holds `None` and every
//! emission point costs one branch.
//!
//! Invariant (same contract as the HUD): pure observation — the recorder is
//! write-only for the state machine and never feeds back into scroll
//! behavior. IO failures drop the record and disable the recorder with a
//! single `tracing::warn!` (never stderr — that is the TUI's terminal), and
//! never panic.
