//! Off-draw-thread Mermaid render worker, per-session disk cache, and the
//! [`AgentView`] lazy render-on-click glue (both `[Open]` and `[Copy path]`).
//!
//! Mirrors the existing inline-video worker model (`std::thread::spawn` +
//! `std::sync::mpsc`, polled each tick via `try_recv`) rather than tokio. A
//! single worker thread renders a requested diagram (in a short-lived child
//! process — see below), writes the PNG to the session's `mermaid/` dir, and
//! reports back only the on-disk path. Diagrams are never displayed inline; the
//! path is what the affordance row's `[Open]`/`[Copy path]` actions target.
//!
//! Rendering is **lazy**: nothing renders until the user clicks `[Open]` or
//! `[Copy path]`, which renders the diagram at the *live* theme/width (so it
//! always matches the current theme, including auto day/night) and then runs the
//! requested action. A small lock-free [`PendingMermaidAction`] list records what
//! the user asked for so the tick can complete it when the matching render result
//! arrives — mirroring how inline video loads via `mpsc` + poll.
//!
//! # Crash isolation under `panic = "abort"` — out of process
//!
//! The shipped CLI profiles build with `panic = "abort"`, so the `catch_unwind`
//! inside [`pi_mermaid::render_checked`] is a no-op there: a panic in the
//! layout engine over untrusted model output would abort the whole pager, and a
//! synchronous in-process render could not be killed on timeout. The render
//! therefore runs **out of process**, in a short-lived child:
//!
//! 1. The pager re-execs itself as `pi-pager __mermaid-render` (see
//!    [`maybe_run_render_subprocess`], intercepted at the very top of `main`
//!    before any TUI/agent/runtime init). The child reads the source from stdin
//!    and the theme/width/height from argv, renders source → SVG → PNG, writes
//!    the PNG atomically to the out-path, and exits 0; any error exits non-zero.
//! 2. The worker spawns that child with a wall-clock budget ([`RENDER_TIMEOUT`])
//!    via [`pi_mermaid::run_with_timeout`], which **kills and reaps** the
//!    child (real process kill, not a soft signal) on timeout. A child panic
//!    (abort), non-zero exit, or timeout is contained to the child and surfaces
//!    as `Failed` → the existing code-block fallback; the pager survives.
//! 3. The child applies the same caps as in-process would: the source-size limit
//!    ([`pi_mermaid::RenderLimits`]) and the raster megapixel/height caps
//!    (see `pi-mermaid`). The parent also rejects obviously-oversized
//!    source before spawning, to avoid launching a doomed child.
//!
//! Because untrusted source now renders fully isolated, the feature is on by
//! default (no cargo gate); the `appearance.render_mermaid` setting still gates
//! it at runtime.
