//! `/dashboard` — open the Agent Dashboard view.
//!
//! Centralised overview of every running session (top-level + subagents)
//! with peek, attach, and dispatch from one screen. The dashboard reuses
//! the existing fullscreen subagent takeover for "attach to subagent",
//! so attaching never bypasses `active_subagent`.
//!
//! Same `Action`-only run path as other session-less commands, no args.
//! `/sessions` is an alias (see [`SlashCommand::aliases`]): the dashboard
//! replaced the removed sessions picker modal for switching, renaming, and
//! closing active sessions. Visibility is feature-flag-gated: the
//! command is hidden by default in the registry and revealed when the
//! dashboard feature is enabled (`dashboard_enabled()`), via
//! [`crate::app::agent_view::AgentView::set_dashboard_visible`]. When
//! `[dashboard].enabled = false` or `GROK_AGENT_DASHBOARD=0` is set, the
//! dispatcher prints a friendly toast and refuses to open. The dashboard is
//! independent of leader mode.
