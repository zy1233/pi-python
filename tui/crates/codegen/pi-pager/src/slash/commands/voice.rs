//! `/voice` — toggle dictation: start recording now, stop with Esc or Enter
//! (Enter also sends). Not written to `config.toml`.
//!
//! The keyboard chord is **Ctrl+Space** or **F8** (both work; F8 is a fallback
//! where Ctrl+Space is taken — e.g. macOS input switching). Its behavior follows
//! `[ui].voice_capture_mode`: `toggle` (press starts, press again stops — like
//! `/voice`) or `hold`-to-talk (hold to record, release to stop), with `hold`
//! available only on terminals that report key releases (Kitty protocol) and
//! falling back to toggle elsewhere. The recording banner is the only feedback;
//! no toast.
//!
//! Dictation works on the agent screen (into the prompt) and on the dashboard
//! (into the dispatch / new-agent input).
//!
//! **Scope.** On for the rest of the process; re-open `grok` for a clean slate.
