//! Slash command trait and execution types.
//!
//! Pager's synchronous dispatch model. Key differences:
//!
//! - `run()` is synchronous (no `async_trait`). Commands that need async work
//!   return `CommandResult::Action(action)` and let the dispatch layer handle it.
//! - `CommandResult` has additional variants: `Action`, `QueueCommand`, `PassThrough`.
//! - Trait methods return `&str` (not `&'static str`) to support ACP-sourced commands.
//! - `args_required()` added for the two-bit completeness model.
//! - `validate_args()` intentionally omitted in phase 1 (folded into `run()`).
