//! Mermaid diagram detection and the on-screen affordance row.
//!
//! The markdown renderer draws ` ```mermaid ` blocks inline as Unicode
//! box-drawing art. This module detects those blocks in an agent message (via
//! the generic [`CodeBlockSpan`](pi_markdown::CodeBlockSpan) API) and
//! exposes each diagram's clean source so a full-fidelity PNG can be rendered on
//! demand. It never renders and tracks no per-diagram render state (rendering is
//! lazy, driven by the affordance row on click). For `auto`/`on` a clickable
//! affordance row (`◇ mermaid [Open Image] [Copy Image Path] [Copy Source]`) is
//! placed beneath the inline art; for `off` only the inline art is shown. The
//! rendered PNG is never drawn inline — it is reached only through the affordance
//! row's actions.
