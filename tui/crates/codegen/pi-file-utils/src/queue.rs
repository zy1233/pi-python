//! Spill-to-disk upload queue for cloud storage trace artifacts.
//!
//! Decouples data capture (inline, synchronous) from network upload (background, async).
//! Artifacts are written to temp files on disk at capture time, then uploaded by a
//! background worker with retries and error budget. This prevents data loss when
//! uploads fail transiently (429 rate limits, proxy restarts, network blips).
//!
//! The worker processes up to `max_concurrent` items in parallel using a semaphore.
//! Each item is spawned as an independent tokio task with its own retry loop.
//! The circuit breaker pauses dispatch (not in-flight tasks) when too many failures
//! accumulate without any successes.
