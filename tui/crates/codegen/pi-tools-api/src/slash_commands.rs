         3. Do NOT execute the prompt inline. The scheduler fires it immediately.\n\n\

# Imagine Video

Video starts from an image — there is no text-to-video tool. \
Default to `image_to_video`; use `reference_to_video` when the user \
explicitly asks for it, a shot genuinely needs multiple reference images, \
or the subject should speak in a specific preset voice (`voices`).

If a video tool fails with a zero-data-retention (ZDR) storage error, relay \
that error verbatim and stop the workflow — do not generate more source \
images or retry.

## Default: single clip

Unless the user asks for a long video, multiple scenes, or a multi-shot sequence, \
generate **one** video:

1. Create a source image with `image_gen` that stages the first frame \
(composition, subject, lighting).
2. Call `image_to_video` with that image and a short prompt describing the motion \
or camera move (1–2 sentences, present tense).
3. After the tool completes, mention the saved file path so the user can find it.

## Longer / multi-shot videos

When the user requests a longer video, multiple scenes, or a narrative sequence:

1. **Plan the story as shots** — break the idea into distinct shots, one beat each.
2. **Favor frequent, short shots** — prefer more 6s clips over fewer long ones; more cuts keep it dynamic.
3. **Create each shot's source image** with `image_gen` (or `image_edit` to combine references), keeping characters and settings consistent across shots.
4. **Animate each shot with `image_to_video`** — the source image becomes frame 1.
5. **Assemble with FFmpeg** using stream copy (`ffmpeg -f concat ... -c copy` — never re-encode). \
Keep every shot at the same resolution and frame rate so the concat works. \
After assembly, mention the final output path.

## Shot guidance

- **Prompt-craft:** one short, vivid moment in present tense with a clear camera movement, in 1–2 sentences.
- **Minimal but interesting:** one clear subject, one simple motion or camera move per shot. Avoid complex multi-action animation; make the shot compelling through composition, lighting, and a strong moment.
- **Complex source image?** Intricate frames (busy geometry, fine detail, heavy reflections) warp when animated. Keep the subject fixed and move only the camera (slow push-in, orbit, or parallax), or break into simpler shots. For new shots, generate a simpler, animation-friendly base image rather than animating a busy one.
- **`image_to_video` animates from frame 1** — stage the first frame with `image_gen`/`image_edit` before animating.
- **Aspect ratio:** set it on the source image (`image_gen` `aspect_ratio`); don't re-crop an existing video.
- **Duration:** 6s or 10s only (prefer 6s); round to the nearest. `reference_to_video` accepts 1–15s.
- **Speaking subjects:** to give a subject a voice, use `reference_to_video` with `voices` (up to 3 preset voice identifiers, e.g. \"ara\", \"eve\") and tag them in the prompt as `<AUDIO_0>`…; combine with reference `images` tagged `<IMAGE_0>`… for a consistent character.
- **Real people:** reference-first — drive the video from a verified reference image; never animate a named person without one.
- Don't loop the same clip unless asked.";
