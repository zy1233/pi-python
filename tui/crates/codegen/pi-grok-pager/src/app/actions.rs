//! Application actions, effects, and task results.
//!
//! This module defines the three enums that form the backbone of the
//! event→dispatch→effect pipeline:
//!
//! - [`Action`] — produced by input handling, consumed by dispatch (sync).
//! - [`Effect`] — produced by dispatch, consumed by the event loop (async).
//! - [`TaskResult`] — produced by spawned tasks, fed back into dispatch.
