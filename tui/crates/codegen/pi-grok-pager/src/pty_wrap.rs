//! Local PTY wrapper: the engine behind `grok wrap` (see [`crate::wrap_cmd`]).
//!
//! Spawns a command inside a local pseudo-terminal and pipes its output
//! through `crate::wrap_filter::Osc52Filter`, which intercepts OSC 52
//! clipboard sequences (making "copy" work for programs that cannot reach the
//! user's clipboard — containers, SSH — even under terminals without OSC 52
//! support), answers the private host clipboard image request OSC (see
//! [`crate::wrap_clipboard_image`]), and reports DEC private mode changes to
//! `crate::wrap_restore::ModeTracker`.
//!
//! This module owns the process plumbing: PTY setup, the writer/stdin/resize
//! threads, and — via the tracker — the exit paths that restore the outer
//! terminal (drop guard, termination-signal thread) when the wrapped command
