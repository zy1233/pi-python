//! Full-text search over scrollback text, scanned on a background thread.
//!
//! [`ScrollbackSearchIndex`] caches each entry's [`searchable_text`] (rendered
//! plain text for markdown blocks, stored source for the rest) keyed by the
//! scrollback's `content_generation`. It holds one owned `String` per entry
//! (never a per-rendered-line `Vec`), so memory tracks total searchable-text
//! size rather than rendered-line count.
//!
//! The cache is shared as an `Arc<[IndexedEntry]>` so it can be handed to a
//! background [`SearchDaemon`] without re-cloning the strings. The daemon runs
//! the regex scan off the input thread: query mutations only enqueue the latest
//! corpus and query (O(1) on the UI thread), and
//! [`ScrollbackSearchState::poll`] picks up results once the scan completes.
//! This keeps per-keystroke typing responsive on long sessions where a
//! synchronous scan would stall the input thread.
