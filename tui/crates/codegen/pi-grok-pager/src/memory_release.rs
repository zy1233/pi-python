//! Allocator memory-release seam.
//!
//! jemalloc keeps freed pages attached to the process, so the multi-hundred-MB
//! transients a large session stages linger after they drop. The pager library
//! cannot reference jemalloc, so the composition-root binary installs an
//! arena-purge hook here via an IoC seam and the library calls
//! [`release_retained_memory`] after heavy transient drops to return the
//! pages to the OS. Absent a hook (tests, non-jemalloc builds) everything is
//! inert.
//!
//! Purges are edge-triggered on an actual drop, never per frame; draw/tick-path
//! cliffs defer to the post-flush gap so a purge never stalls the frame.
