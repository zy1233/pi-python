//! Shared helper for resolving `[Image #N: <path>]` placeholders into
//! image bytes.
//!
//! Both the TUI ([`pi_grok_pager::prompt_images`]) and the server-side
//! ingestion path ([`crate::session::acp_session`]) need to recover image
//! bytes when a placeholder lacks an attached `PastedImage` /
//! `ContentBlock::Image` — e.g. a paste from a previous session's
//! prompt, a session reload, or a synthetic re-render. The two sides
//! share one canonical loader so the validation rules (extension
//! allowlist, prefix allowlist, size cap, image-decoder validation,
//! aggregate-bytes cap) cannot drift.
//!
//! ## Threat model
//!
//! The placeholder path is **user-controlled** but the user does not
//! explicitly opt in to reading any arbitrary file — they paste a chat
//! transcript fragment and the agent may resurrect it across sessions.
//! To stop the placeholder mechanism from becoming a generic file
//! exfiltration sink, the loader is intentionally conservative:
//!
//! * Canonicalises every candidate path (resolves `..` and symlinks).
//! * Asserts the canonical target lives under an explicit prefix
//!   allowlist (workspace cwd + a small set of common user-image
//!   directories under `$HOME`; never the whole `$HOME`). See
//!   [`default_allowed_prefixes`].
//! * Asserts the extension is in [`ALLOWED_IMAGE_EXTENSIONS`].
//! * Routes the bytes through the `image` crate's full header parser
//!   ([`image::ImageReader::with_guessed_format`] +
//!   `into_dimensions`) so magic-byte forgery — a PNG-prefix file
//!   followed by arbitrary content — is rejected. See
//!   [`PlaceholderLoadError::NotAnImage`].
//! * Rejects any canonical path containing a known sensitive-bundle
//!   subtree (`.photoslibrary/`, `.musiclibrary/`, etc.) even when the
//!   parent prefix is in the allowlist.
//! * Enforces a per-image byte cap, a per-prompt placeholder count
//!   cap, and a per-prompt aggregate-bytes cap so a single prompt
//!   cannot trigger huge sequential syscall chains or memory spikes.
//!
//! Wire format: `[Image #<n>: <absolute_path>]` — the producer is
//! [`pi_grok_pager::prompt_images::display_text`]. The shape of this
//! placeholder is part of the chat-history contract — do NOT change
//! it. The regex requires the literal `": "` separator that the
//! producer always emits; see [`extract_placeholders`].
//!
//! ## `file://` URI convention
//!
//! Both the TUI's `prompt_images::build_content_blocks_with_workspace`
//! and the server-side recovery in [`recover_orphan_placeholders`]
//! emit `file://{canonical.display()}` URIs **without** percent-encoding
//! the path. This deviates from RFC 3986 (a path with spaces should be
//! `%20`-encoded) but it is internally consistent across producer and
//! consumer: [`canonical_from_file_uri`] parses inbound URIs using both
//! the relaxed unencoded form **and** percent-decoded form so dedup
//! works against either convention. Do **not** add percent-encoding on
//! one side without also doing it on the other — past-issue: producer
//! / consumer asymmetry breaks dedup.
