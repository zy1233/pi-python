//! Cross-platform system **sleep/wake** (suspend/resume) notifications.
//!
//! The motivating use case: an OIDC token refresh that is *in flight when the
//! laptop sleeps* can lose its rotated successor token (the server processes
//! the request, rotates/revokes the old refresh token, and the response is
//! lost across the suspend). On wake the client is holding a dead refresh
//! token and the user is forced to re-login. See
//! `pi-shell`'s `AuthManager` sleep gate, which consumes these events to
//! avoid *starting* a refresh just before sleep. An in-flight refresh is
//! deliberately left to finish, never aborted (dropping it could discard a
//! rotated-token response and cause the very revocation this guards against);
//! instead, its [`PowerEvent::WillSleep`] handler may block briefly (bounded)
//! to hold off the suspend until that in-flight refresh completes — see the
//! callback contract below.
//!
//! This crate exposes a single tiny abstraction — [`SystemPowerListener`] —
//! with per-OS implementations behind `#[cfg]` and a no-op fallback:
//!
//! | OS      | Mechanism                                                            |
//! |---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | macOS   | IOKit `IORegisterForSystemPower` on a dedicated `CFRunLoop` thread    |
//! | Windows | `PowerRegisterSuspendResumeNotification` (`DEVICE_NOTIFY_CALLBACK`)   |
//! | Linux   | logind D-Bus `PrepareForSleep` signal + a `delay` inhibitor lock      |
//! | other   | no-op (returns `None` from [`SystemPowerListener::start`])            |
//!
//! The callback fires from a platform event thread/callback, so it must be
//! `Send + Sync`. It should return promptly, but a [`PowerEvent::WillSleep`]
//! handler *may* block for a short, bounded time to hold off sleep: the per-OS
//! implementations acknowledge the transition only **after** the callback
//! returns (macOS calls `IOAllowPowerChange`; Linux releases its `delay`
//! inhibitor), so blocking there delays the suspend itself. Keep any such block
//! within the OS budget — macOS allows ~30 s after `kIOMessageSystemWillSleep`;
//! Linux logind's `InhibitDelayMaxSec` defaults to 5 s — or the OS proceeds to
//! sleep anyway. `DidWake` handlers must stay cheap and non-blocking.
