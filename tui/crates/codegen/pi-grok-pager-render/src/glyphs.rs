//! Legacy-console fallbacks for chrome glyphs that don't ship in the
//! legacy Windows ConHost default font (Consolas / Lucida Console).
//!
//! Fallbacks are ASCII where possible (`x`, `o`, `c`, `*`), or a CP437
//! glyph when one reads better and still renders on the raster font
//! (`✓` → `√` U+221A, `⇣` → `↓` U+2193).
//!
//! ConHost does no font fallback, so missing glyphs render as tofu.
//! Windows Terminal, VS Code, and modern emulators bundle fonts (or
//! fall back to one) that cover the Dingbats / symbol glyphs we use as
//! chrome — `❯` (U+276F), `❙` (U+2759), `✗` (U+2717), `✓` (U+2713),
//! `↗` (U+2197), `⧉` (U+29C9), `⇣` (U+21E3), the diamonds `◆`/`◇`/`◈`
//! (U+25C6 / U+25C7 / U+25C8), and the braille / dot progress spinners —
//! so the substitution only fires for legacy `cmd.exe` / `powershell.exe`.
