//! Lightweight process-spawning utilities for TTY safety.
//!
//! When a TUI/pager/raw-mode terminal owns the parent process's controlling
//! TTY, every child process must be detached — otherwise it (or its
//! grandchildren: npm, git, pinentry, ssh-agent …) can open `/dev/tty`
//! directly and spew mouse escape codes, capability-probe replies, or
//! credential prompts onto the live screen.
//!
//! This crate provides the minimal surface needed to make subprocess spawning
//! safe. It is intentionally tiny so that **every** crate in the workspace
//! can depend on it without pulling in heavyweight libraries.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use pi_tty_utils::{detach_command, pager_env};
//! use std::process::Stdio;
//!
//! let mut cmd = tokio::process::Command::new("git");
//! cmd.args(["status", "--porcelain"]);
//! detach_command(&mut cmd);
//! cmd.stdin(Stdio::null());
//! cmd.envs(pager_env());
//! ```
//!
//! For `std::process::Command`:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use pi_tty_utils::{detach_std_command, pager_env};
//! use std::process::Stdio;
//!
//! let mut cmd = std::process::Command::new("git");
//! cmd.args(["log", "--oneline"]);
//! detach_std_command(&mut cmd);
//! cmd.stdin(Stdio::null());
//! cmd.envs(pager_env());
//! ```

// A panic on a teardown path leaks whatever it was about to free; tests panic freely.
