//! Sweep-harness stage marks for the subagent spawn pipeline. Disabled by
//! default: the disabled path is a single atomic sink check and reads no clock.
//! `GROK_SUBAGENT_WATERFALL=1` writes to stderr; a `/path` value appends to
//! that file so the regression tier can parse its own marks back. Timestamps
//! are monotonic micros from a process epoch ([`now_us`]): wall clocks step
//! under NTP and skew segment math.
//!
//! Mark ids: a subagent's mark id is its request id, which equals both the
//! child session id and the Task tool's `task_id`.
//!
//! Deliberately NOT a `SubagentSpawnPhase` sink: marks need a monotonic
//! clock shared with out-of-process consumers (the harness's client events
//! and mock arrivals), while the analytics schema is a closed, wall-clock-free
//! set of per-spawn durations.
//!
//! `pub` for the sweep harness only.
