//! Session-actor side `StatusDispatcher` for MCP client events.
//!
//! Receives [`pi_grok_mcp::servers::McpClientEvent`]s emitted by:
//! - per-client transport-liveness watchers
//!   ([`pi_grok_mcp::liveness`]),
//! - the [`pi_grok_mcp::servers::GrokClientHandler`] (server-pushed
//!   `tools/list_changed` and `resources/list_changed`),
//! - the `ensure_initialized` success/failure path,
//! - the session MCP config diff path (`UpdateMcpServers` / toggle).
//!
//! Coalesces events in a **50 ms tumbling window** keyed by
//! `(server_name, McpClientEventKind)`. Two events with the same key
//! collapse into the latest one — e.g. an MCP server bursting 100
//! `tools/list_changed` notifications inside 10 ms produces exactly
//! one ACP push.
//!
//! Each surviving entry is emitted as an ACP
//! [`agent_client_protocol::ExtNotification`] with method
//! `x.ai/mcp/server_status` and the payload schema defined by
//! [`McpServerStatusPayload`].
//!
//! ## Doc-comment ↔ implementation contract
//!
//! - Coalescing window is exactly 50 ms, tumbling — events received
//!   during the window are buffered, then flushed on the next tick.
//! - Per `(server, kind)` collapse: the *latest* event wins (events
//!   inserted into a `HashMap` are overwritten by later inserts).
//! - `ConfigDiff` is fanned out per-server, **not** stored as a
//!   single event in the buffer.
//! - The bounded auto-restart task wires in: after a
//!   window flush, the dispatcher hands off each `TransportClosed` /
//!   `HandshakeFailed` key to
//!   [`crate::session::mcp_restart::maybe_schedule_restart`], which
//!   applies the stdio-only / shutting-down / configured-and-enabled
//!   guard rails before spawning
//!   [`crate::session::mcp_restart::auto_restart_stdio`]. The
//!   dispatcher itself stays single-purpose: coalesce + push.
