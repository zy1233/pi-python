//! Plan mode state machine and prompt text generation.
//!
//! This module contains the [`PlanModeTracker`] struct that manages
//! the full plan mode lifecycle for a session. It is designed to be
//! testable in isolation — no references to `SessionActor`, conversation
//! history, or async I/O. Pure state machine logic.
//!
//! The `SessionActor` owns one `PlanModeTracker` (behind a `Mutex`) and
//! calls its methods at the appropriate points (`handle_session_mode`,
//! `handle_prompt`, `handle_completion`, `run_compact`).
