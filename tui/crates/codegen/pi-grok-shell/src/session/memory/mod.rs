//! Memory system shim.
//!
//! The memory "core engine" now lives in the standalone `pi-grok-memory`
//! crate. This module re-exports that crate's public surface under the
//! historical `crate::session::memory::*` paths so the ~30 reverse-dependency
//! call sites in this crate keep compiling unchanged.
//!
//! Only `hooks` stays here: it is session glue (depends on
//! `crate::sampling` and `crate::session::helpers::session_compact`) and is
//! not part of the relocatable core engine.
