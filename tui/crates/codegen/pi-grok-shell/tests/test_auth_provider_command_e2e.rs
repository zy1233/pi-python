//! End-to-end guard for `auth_provider_command`: a configured external auth
//! provider must actually mint the session credential on the host platform.
//!
//! Regression cover. The provider used to be spawned through a hardcoded
//! `sh -c`. On Windows that either fails to spawn (no `sh` in a default
//! install) or, where Git Bash is present, silently eats the backslashes in a
//! native path — `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe` reaches the shell as
//! `C:WindowsSystem32whoami.exe` and exits 127. Either way the auth flow fell
//! through to the built-in browser login, so a configured provider looked like
//! it had been ignored.
//!
//! The test drives the public entry point (`try_ensure_fresh_auth` →
//! `AuthManager::auth` → external refresher → platform shell) and is hermetic:
//! a throwaway `GROK_HOME`, no network, and a provider command that needs no
//! binary beyond what the platform shell already provides.
