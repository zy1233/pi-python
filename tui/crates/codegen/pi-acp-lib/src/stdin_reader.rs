//! Dedicated-thread reader for the ACP stdio transport's standard input.
//!
//! Every ACP client (VS Code extension, grok-desktop, the leader bridge) drives
//! the agent over a **persistent, bidirectional** newline-delimited JSON-RPC
//! stream on stdio: it writes requests on the child's stdin and reads responses
//! on stdout, keeping **stdin open for the whole session**.
//!
//! # Why not `tokio::io::stdin()`
//!
//! `tokio::io::stdin()` is not truly asynchronous. Tokio services it with a
//! blocking `std::io` read on an internal pool thread, and that read **cannot be
//! cancelled**. For interactive / persistent uses the
//! [`tokio::io::Stdin`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/io/struct.Stdin.html)
//! docs recommend "spawn a thread dedicated to user input and use blocking IO
//! directly in that thread". [`spawn_stdin_line_reader`] does exactly that.
//!
//! # Why the reader takes *exclusive* ownership of stdin (Windows)
//!
//! `std::io::Stdin` is a process-global handle guarded by a re-entrant mutex
//! (the `StdinLock`). A blocking read **holds that lock for the entire duration
//! of the read** — and for the persistent stdio transport the reader is almost
//! always parked in a read, waiting for the client's next line. If *any other*
//! code in the process then calls `std::io::stdin()` (e.g. a stray interactive
//! prompt reached only on a particular platform), it blocks on the lock until
//! the reader's in-flight read returns — which only happens at **EOF**, i.e.
//! when the client closes stdin. For a persistent ACP client that never closes
//! stdin mid-session this is a hard hang: the agent freezes part-way through a
//! request (observed on **Windows** during `session/new`) and only unblocks when
//! the transport is torn down. macOS/Linux don't reach the offending stray read,
//! so they were unaffected — but the hazard is real on any platform.
//!
//! To make the transport robust, on Windows the reader thread takes a **private
//! duplicate** of the real stdin handle and then points the process's standard
//! input at **`NUL`**. The reader keeps reading the client's bytes through its
//! private handle, while every *other* `std::io::stdin()` read in the process
//! observes immediate EOF instead of deadlocking on the lock. This mirrors what
//! already makes leader mode safe (the agent subprocess is spawned with
//! `stdin = NUL`, so its stray reads EOF instantly). Unix keeps reading
//! `std::io::stdin()` directly — it has no second stdin reader on these paths
//! and the extra FFI/`dup` would add risk for no benefit.
//!
//! # Escaped-slash normalization (acp 0.6 wire workaround)
//!
//! Every line is forwarded through `normalize_json_line` — see the
//! crate-private `normalize` module for the contract and its scope.
