//! Heuristic stop-detector for premature "give up" turn endings.
//!
//! The model is judged to be bailing out when the LAST non-empty
//! paragraph of its turn-final text starts with one of the patterns
//! commonly used as a bail / hand-off / verdict signal.
//! On a hit, `maybe_queue_goal_continuation` (reached on the success /
//! continuation path) renders the bail-specific continuation nudge
//! instead of the generic one and the harness emits
//! `Event::GoalPrematureStopDetected { pattern }` tagged with the
//! matched pattern label so dashboards can audit precision / recall of
//! the regex panel.
//!
//! Each regex is locked to a source-string constant in
//! [`STOP_REGEX_SOURCES`] by a regression test (asserting each
//! `Regex::as_str()` matches) so a later refactor cannot silently
//! swap a pattern out. Two patterns are expressed in two stages
//! rather than as a single regex:
//!
//! 1. [`CHECK_BACK_LATER`] — a single-regex form would need a negative
//!    lookahead `(?!your?\b)` that the `regex` crate does not
//!    support; we implement the same semantics in two stages
//!    (broad first-stage regex + `your`/`you` post-filter in
//!    `check_back_later_matches`).
//! 2. `STOPPING_HERE` — the base trailer set
//!    `(?:\.|$| \u2014| -| until| pending| since| because)` is
//!    widened to include `,`, `;`, and ` for ` so naturally-occurring
//!    sign-offs like "Stopping here for now.", "Stopping here, will
//!    come back later.", and "Paused here; review needed." still
//!    fire. The widening is bounded by a non-letter boundary in the
//!    tests so in-word matches like "Stopping hereafter" stay
//!    rejected.
//!
//! Intentionally omitted from this panel: a broad catch-all
//! "continuation deferral" pattern (`\b(?:once|when|after|until|
//! as soon as)\b…`). Stand-alone it fires on routine work narration
//! ("Once the test settles I'll iterate") and the resulting false-
//! positive rate dwarfs the bail signal we care about; the more
//! specific patterns below already cover the bail surface.
//!
//! Regexes are anchored with `^` so the marker must start a line; in-
//! prose mentions like "I can't continue without your input" mid-
//! sentence are intentionally ignored.
