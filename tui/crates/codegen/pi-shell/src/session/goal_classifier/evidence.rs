//! Evidence-packet construction for the goal-verification stage.
//!
//! The packet is a strictly-formatted block that each adversarial
//! skeptic subagent receives as its user prompt:
//!
//! ```text
//! OBJECTIVE:
//! <objective>
//!
//! CHANGES_FILE: <patch path or `(unavailable)`>
//!
//! CHANGED_FILES:
//! - <path>
//! ...
//!
//! PLAN_FILE: <plan path or `(unavailable)`>
//!
//! PLAN_CHANGES: <unified diff of plan edits, or `(none)`>
//!
//! FINAL_RESPONSE:
//! <last assistant text, sanitized>
//! ```
//!
//! `PLAN_CHANGES` is the baseline→current diff of the plan file (the
//! agent may edit `plan.md` mid-run); `(none)` when there is no baseline,
//! no edits, or the diff could not be captured.
//!
//! `CHANGES_FILE` is a unified-diff *changelog* (a scope pointer, and
//! the anchor for the claim↔diff honesty check) — it may be truncated.
//! `CHANGED_FILES` is the *complete* list of touched paths the skeptic
//! reads in their current state; verification rests on the live files
//! and on running the code, not on the diff alone. The section names
//! are consumed verbatim by `templates/goal_verifier_prompt.md`, so the
//! format constants here are load-bearing and must not change without
//! updating the template (and bumping any prompt-eval baselines).
