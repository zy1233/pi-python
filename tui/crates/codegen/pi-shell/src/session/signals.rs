//! Session signals tracking for feedback heuristics.
//!
//! This module tracks session-level signals that inform feedback request decisions.
//! Signals are collected locally in the agent and periodically synced to the
//! backend for analytics / telemetry persistence.
//!
//! Uses a channel-based actor pattern to avoid locks:
//! - `SessionSignalsHandle` is a cheap, cloneable sender for reporting signals
//! - `SessionSignalsActor` runs as a background task processing signal events
//! - Snapshots are requested via oneshot channels for async response
