//! System-sleep refresh-straddle mitigation for [`AuthManager`].
//!
//! A refresh that straddles a suspend can lose its rotated successor token,
//! leaving a revoked refresh token on disk and forcing re-login. Two layers
//! guard against that straddle:
//!
//! 1. The gate `refresh_chain` consults *defers* a not-yet-started refresh; an
//!    in-flight one is never aborted (dropping it could discard a rotated-token
//!    response — the very revocation we guard against). See
//!    [`AuthManager::refresh_chain`].
//! 2. When sleep becomes imminent and a refresh *is* already in flight,
//!    [`AuthManager::set_system_sleep_imminent`] briefly **holds the OS sleep
//!    acknowledgment** (macOS delays `IOAllowPowerChange`; Linux holds its
//!    `delay` inhibitor — both via the blocking power-listener callback) until
//!    the refresh drains or [`SLEEP_ACK_MAX_WAIT`] elapses, so the in-flight
//!    exchange finishes *before* the machine suspends.
//!
//! Split out of `manager.rs` so the manager stays scannable: this is a
//! self-contained unit (the [`SleepGate`] type, the [`InFlightGuard`], and a
//! small `impl AuthManager` block driving them from OS power events).
