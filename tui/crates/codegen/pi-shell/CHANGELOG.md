# Changelog

# 1.0.8 — 2026-08-20

## Features

- MCP servers can now ask for form input or URL consent through the same popup used for questions.

## Bug Fixes

- **Image paste** over grok wrap now works on headless remotes.

# 0.2.107 — 2026-07-20

## Features

- **Stop hooks** can now keep the agent running by feeding feedback back to the model instead of ending the turn.
