//!
//! Used by both the optional [`crate::MmdcEngine`] (which shells out to
//! `mmdc`/headless-Chromium) and the pager's out-of-process render child (a
//! short-lived re-exec of the pager that renders one diagram in isolation). The
//! timeout is a *real* process kill, not a soft signal: a panic under
//! `panic = "abort"` or a runaway render in the child is contained because the
//! parent kills and reaps it.
//!
//! The caller builds the [`Command`] (stdio, env, and the sanctioned
//! TTY/console detach via `pi_tty_utils::detach_std_command`); this module only
//! owns the spawn → feed-stdin → wait → reap lifecycle so neither call site
//! re-implements process-group teardown.
