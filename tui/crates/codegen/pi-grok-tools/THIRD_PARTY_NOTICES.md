# Third-Party Notices

This crate contains code ported from, or derived from, the open-source
projects listed under [Ported source code](#ported-source-code), and its
release builds embed prebuilt third-party tool binaries listed under
[Bundled tool binaries](#bundled-tool-binaries). The original license terms
are reproduced below, as required by those licenses.

Ported files have been modified from their originals (translated between
languages, adapted to this crate's `Tool` trait and runtime, and extended);
this file constitutes the prominent notice of those changes required by
Apache License 2.0 §4(b).

## Ported source code

### openai/codex

The tool implementations under `src/implementations/codex/` (`apply_patch`,
`grep_files`, `list_dir`, `read_file`) are ported from the
[openai/codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) project
(`codex-rs/core/src/tools/handlers/`).

### sst/opencode

The tool implementations under `src/implementations/opencode/` (`bash`,
`edit`, `glob`, `grep`, `read`, `skill`, `todowrite`, `write`) are ported
from the [sst/opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) project
(`packages/opencode/src/tool/`).

## Bundled tool binaries

Release builds of this crate embed unmodified, prebuilt binaries of the
tools below (see `build.rs`); they are self-extracted to `~/.grok/vendor/`
at runtime. Which tools are embedded in a given build depends on what the
release pipeline supplies at build time:

- **ripgrep** is embedded in every release build (downloaded from the
  official GitHub release, or supplied via `GROK_TOOLS_BUNDLE_RG_PATH`).
- **ugrep** and **bfs** are embedded only when the release pipeline supplies
  static binaries via `GROK_TOOLS_BUNDLE_UGREP_PATH` /
  `GROK_TOOLS_BUNDLE_BFS_PATH`. When those are unset the tools are not
  bundled, and the runtime instead resolves them from `~/.grok/vendor/` or
  `$PATH` if the user has installed them. Their license terms are included
  below so that any build that does bundle them is covered.

### ripgrep

[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is dual-licensed under the
MIT License or the Unlicense, at the user's option. We redistribute the
official ripgrep release binaries and reproduce the MIT license below.

The official ripgrep release binaries statically link
[PCRE2](https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2) (BSD-3-Clause with the PCRE2
exemption for binary library-like packages). Under that exemption, packages
that include ripgrep — and do not use PCRE2 independently — are not subject
to PCRE2's binary-redistribution notice condition, so no separate PCRE2
notice is reproduced here.

review what it statically links (e.g. PCRE2, zlib) and extend this notice if
needed.
