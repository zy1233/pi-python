//! OpenCode-specific tool implementations.
//!
//! This module contains tools ported from the [sst/opencode] project
//! (`packages/opencode/src/tool/`), which is licensed under the MIT

//! Most tools follow the opencode parameter
//! naming conventions (e.g., `read`/`edit` use `filePath`, `oldString`,
//! `newString`); `write` is the exception — its input was normalized to
//! snake_case (`file_path`) for grok_build consistency.
