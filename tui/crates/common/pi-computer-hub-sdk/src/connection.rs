//! Per-`(url, principal)` WebSocket connection actor.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Multiple [`crate::ToolServer`] instances in the same process MAY
//! attach to the same server URL with the same credential. Opening one
//! socket per server would multiply server-side connection cost, fan-out
//! the per-tool ack chatter, and make per-frame envelope checks
//! ambiguous (the server can't tell which of N sockets owns a session
//! binding). The pool collapses every `(url, principal)` to one
//! [`HubConnection`]; refcounted session bindings make the collapse
//! safe.
//!
//! # The reconnect / replay state machine
//!
//! When the underlying socket drops, in-flight `tool_call_request`
//! responses CANNOT be recovered (the server holds no replay log). The
//! connection actor therefore:
//!
//! 1. Drains every parked response waiter with
//!    [`crate::ClientError::NetworkError`] so callers can fast-fail
//!    instead of deadlocking.
//! 2. Reconnects with exponential backoff, full jitter, capped at the last slot.
//! 3. Re-runs the `hello` handshake.
//! 4. The ToolServer replays `serve{session_id, tools}` per active
//!    session via the on_reconnect callback. The server auto-registers
//!    sessions from `serve` so no separate wire call is needed.
//! 5. Drains any outbound frames that buffered during step 1-4.
