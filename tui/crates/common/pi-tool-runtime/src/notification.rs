//! Tool notifications — typed messages a running tool emits to subscribers
//! (TUI, gateway, audit log, ...) for live visibility into execution.
//!
//! The enum and its payload structs use unconditional serde derives so wire
//! adapters can serialise them without enabling additional features.
//!
//! Each `ToolNotification` variant has a parallel `send_*` convenience on
//! [`ToolNotificationHandle`]. The two surfaces are kept in lockstep — when
//! adding a variant here, add the `send_*` constructor too.
//!
//! The handle is built on `futures::channel::mpsc` so it is runtime-neutral:
//! the trait crate doesn't pin a particular async executor on its
//! consumers.
