//! Observability seam for intra-compaction.
//!
//! The shared orchestrator reports terminal outcomes through this trait so
//! each harness can emit its own metrics (Grok chat: its own metrics
//! counters/histograms in the harness crate)
//! without the shared crate depending on a metrics backend. Emission points
//! and label values are part of the behavior contract — Grok chat's
//! observer preserves them byte-for-byte.
