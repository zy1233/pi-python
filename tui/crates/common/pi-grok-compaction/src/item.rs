//! Data abstraction — the `CompactionItem` seam.
//!
//! The shared compaction algorithms operate over a sequence of *items*
//! (turns/messages) without knowing the concrete harness type. The chat
//! harness implements [`CompactionItem`] for its `GrokTurn`;
//! grok-build implements it for `pi_grok_sampling_types::ConversationItem`.
//!
//! Keeping the contract minimal is deliberate: the algorithms only need
//! enough structure to (a) classify roles, (b) read text, and (c) preserve
//! the tool-request/tool-result pairing invariant when selecting a split
//! point (an `Assistant(tool_request)` and the `Tool` results that satisfy
//! it must never be separated, or the model API rejects the orphaned tool
//! results with a 400).
//!
//! [`CompactionItemBuilder`] is the *constructive* extension used by the
//! history-compaction algorithms that need to rebuild items (strip prior
//! `<grok_user_queries>` blocks, drop tool content from assistant turns,
//! wrap an LLM summary into a carrier item).

/// Harness-agnostic role of a single conversation item.
