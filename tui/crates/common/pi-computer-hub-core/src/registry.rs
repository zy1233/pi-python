//! Object-safe `ToolRegistry` trait shared by every storage plane.
//!
//! Two registry implementations are expected: one in-memory plane for
//! statically-registered local tools, and one connection-keyed plane fed by
//! incoming remote registrations. Both expose the same trait so the
//! router can compose them through [`crate::CompoundResolver`] without
//! caring which is which.
//!
//! Mutations are connection-scoped: each registered tool belongs to the
//! [`ConnectionId`] that introduced it. Per-tool session bindings live
//! alongside the tool's record and are mutated independently via
//! [`ToolRegistry::bind_tool_session`] / [`ToolRegistry::unbind_tool_session`].
//! Reads (`find_tool`, `list_tools`, `search`) remain session-scoped — the
//! router resolves a tool by `(session_id, tool_id)`, never by
//! connection id.
//!
//! The concrete in-memory implementation is intentionally **out of scope**
//! for this crate — it requires a concurrency story (sharded maps, an
//! actor, etc.) that belongs alongside the registry's collision matrix and
//! generation handling. Tests exercise the trait via per-test mock impls.

///   lives in router state, not the registry) and is never produced by
